                Fio is a Brown Tabby that enjoys exploring, playing, and scratching every piece of woodwork she can get her claws into! 
                
                She was adopted from the Nebraska Humane Society in September 2020, when she was just 4 months old. 
            
                Fio is short for Fiorella. The name is italian for "Little Flower" and comes from one of my favorite animated movies: Porco Rosso.</p>
